This repo contains all the exercises and demo I've done for the react-redux course as part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at [Business College Helsinki](http://bc.fi).
# Redux
`Redux` is a `state management library` for front end applications. Developers commonly use it with React through the react-redux package, but it can also stand alone – so you can use it in any front end framework or library, including Vanilla JavaScript.
## How to Set Up the Project
`npm i redux react-redux`
## Create actions and reducers
### Actions:Actions are what the name implies – they are objects that determine what will be done.

### Reducers: on the other hand, check which action is performed and update the state based on the action. It takes in the state and the action.
